Question 1 

First figure
Sequentially consistent.
Rewrite the history as : 
r.write(1)- r.read(1) - r.write(2)- r.read(2)

It is sequential and preserves program order.

Yes: Since three first method overlap we can reorder them
as before based on linerization points.



Second Figure
Sequentially consistent
r.write(2)- r.write(1) - r.read(1)- r.read(1)
