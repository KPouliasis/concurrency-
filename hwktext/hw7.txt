Exercise 123

All persons/ threads are sitting circularily around the stew.
Each thread- person should operate as follows REPETIVELY:
1.Get stew (no need to protect the stew by a lock by the specifications)
2. Starting from the left and in a circular way if needed find the next of the fellows that is not beeing fed and is hungry.
3. If you are hungry and food is offered eat it. Push the spon away if you are not hungry.


The algorithm is decentralized and low contention since  there is no "spinning" to feed someone.
Once a thread fails to feed someone it moves to the next.
It is starvation free since each thread has spoon and starts rotating it towards its left.
It is deterministic.
