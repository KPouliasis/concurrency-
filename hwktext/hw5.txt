Exercise 94

Permitting this type of "polymorphic" (both read/write threads) seems costly. The fact that 
the read block can "tolerate" many readers but only one "writer" is exactly where things become complex. It is easier to implement such a behavior but classifying threads to readers and writers. This way you can observe cleary when a writer holds the lock and prevent other writers from entering it. This classification is static. It is decided upon the creation of the thread and it never changes. A dynamic approach would be troublesome since a thread's id no longer gives information about if it is allowed to take a lock or not.

Exercise 95

3. No. Transactions might not finish although there will be sufficient funds in the accounts.
The threads might get interrupted when in "waiting room" state before they get notified at 2AM.
